description: How to restore your deleted WattMaven account.

import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Restoring your account will reactivate your WattMaven account and all of your data. Your data will be indexed and
searchable by other users, and you will be able to access all of your projects and resources.

<Aside>
  Accounts can only be recovered within 90 days of deletion. Once restored,
  **you will not automatically be given ownership of any teams you previously
  owned**. You will need to be re-invited to any teams you were a member of.
</Aside>

## Steps

1. Go to the [console](https://console.wattmaven.com) and sign in.
2. You will be redirected to a restoration page. Click the **Restore acount** button.
